📘 IHC Calculator

Open-source tool for computing the Hydrosedimentological Connectivity Index (IHC) using Taudem algorithms.

The IHC Calculator is a free and open-source tool designed to estimate the Hydrosedimentological Connectivity Index (IHC) at catchment scale. The tool builds upon the theoretical framework of the Index of Connectivity (IC) originally proposed by Borselli et al. (2008) and later modified by Cavalli et al. (2013), integrating hydrological information such as precipitation and surface runoff as functional components of connectivity.
